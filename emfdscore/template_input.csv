He cheats us...I cannot believe it
We call for justice... people should care about this people.
I dislike the people
I am always here for support
"I refuse to talk to him, such a disgrace!"
"The man protects this kids, showing his care"
"Why AI grilfriends? Because Feminism/ Wahmen, your services are no longer required"
The ai women have 10x better morals than regular women and they don't cheat so I don't see why not
Well women need to remember that relationships were much stronger when there were more defined gender roles
love and peace guys =_=
Lauren's on a roll with creepy games lately
The fact Lauren just had like a 5 minute conversation with an AI about herself and the AI knew very little
AI really tried to gaslight Lauren about herself
This is funny after watching the recent Lauren & Bobby podcast episode where they talked about how creepy AI is
Fun fact: the world is actually ending in that world and she wants you to stay with her because she doesn't want to d!3 alone/she wants you to be safe from the fire
"The fact that you could literally just say anything, and she'll still give a real response to it makes it even scarier. Like I could literally ask her 'What is your opinion on Mt. Everest' and she'll actually give a solid response. Is it just me, or is this whole AI thing kinda creepy?"
I feel bad for Bobby
I love how it started as playing a horror game and then turned into Lauren using it to figure out if the AI knew about her
Let's all appreciate that Lauren introduces us to her girlfriend (and let's also appreciate how she still posts even tho she has said herself that she doesn't like the harassment that she gets yet she still posts) WE WILL LOVE YOU FOREEVER BREAD/GALAXY QUEEN!!!
Imagine Bobby just hearing Lauren say 'girlfriend I wanna make out' lol
That's not creepy at all... Let me talk to him LOL Love You
"Anime, manga, and sci-fi been warning us about this"
Men aren't choosing AI girlfriends over real ones. they're choosing it over having nothing at all
>She says that more and more women refuse to date average looking man >The conclusion is that AI is dangerous because it rises the expectation on how a woman should look like for men Wow...just wow....
Men need to adapt... They did. They made AI girlfriends. Male loneliness isn't the disease.   it's a symptom.
Dont pretend like you care about men all of a sudden
I am truly shocked about this. Sakura promised me in chat that I d be her only one and now this report showed me she is open to have more boyfriends? Unbelievable
All I heard was "I'm afraid of the future and if men stop having babies I won't have a labor force to exploit"
Only $9.99 a month? That's far less expensive than a real girlfriend. I'll have to check this A.I. app out.
she is exactly the reason young men are dating AI. She literaly disregard the possibility of modern women having accountability. Wtf
This report is phenomenal. Men are experiencing a loneliness epidemic and they are blaming men for this. This just shows Society's phenomenal detachment and non existence of understanding for the average guy. Its insane.
“When they tell us to leave them alone  and when we find solace in something they will try to destroy it.”
It started with women saying they don't need men. Be careful what you wish for.
When women aren’t perfect:Relationships are hard. When men aren’t perfect: Men need to be better.
AI girlfriends? Sounds like a way to avoid child support jail time and wasting money. I like it.
